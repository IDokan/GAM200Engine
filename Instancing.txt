- Introduce Instancing
- Describe what is a difference between Instancing and InstancedArray (Pros & Cons)
- Let readers know I'm ready to get a constructive feedback and coding part going to start
- Codings...


Work load
	- Mesh (Seems done)
	- Vertices (Seems done)
		- VertexLayoutDescription (Seems done)
	- Special object capable instance drawing (Now Implementing..)

A bunch of drawing functions
- glDrawArrays
- glDrawElements

"Since we're not using an element index buffer we're going to call the glDrawArrays.
It seems there are no difference without parameters in docs.gl.

However, in this discussion..
https://community.khronos.org/t/whats-the-difference-between-gldrawarrays-and-gldrawelement/858
glDrawArrays discharge the vertices in linear order, as they are stored in the vertex arrays.
glDrawElement make me have to supply an index buffer. Indices allow us to submit the vertices in any order,
and to reuse vertices that are shared between triangles.
